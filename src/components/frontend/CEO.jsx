                  We are committed to maintain a partnership based on

                  It has been a very challenging journey from the beginning of
                  our company in 2021 A.D until today. Having started as a small
                  family business, we are now among the top Buddist contracting
                  companies in Nepal. Our major challenge today is to sustain
                  our growth while maintaining a conservative financial
                  strategy.
